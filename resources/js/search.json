[[{"l":"Transfer Toolbox","p":["After very careful consideration, we've decided to stop the development of Transfer Toolbox.","Apple seems to have been able to almost \"start from scratch\" with the iPad, and build newer modern frameworks, to really push the boundaries of what you can do on Apple Silicon.","As we dug deeper into how Final Cut Pro (for Mac) Libraries differ from Final Cut Pro (for iPad) Projects with each update - it became obvious that, the technologies between the two platforms is quite different, and ever evolving.","Because we use Sync-N-Link for synchronising all our timecode-synced cameras and external audio recorders, our ideal workflow was to be able to prepare everything on Mac, and just send across a Library from Mac to iPad, so that creatives/directors could start doing selects/favouriting directly on the iPad.","Before releasing on GitHub, we had 107 beta testers on Apple's TestFlight, which provided really useful support and feedback. There was a lot of interest on social media.","Directors loved being able to do fast selects/favourites using their Apple Pencil on the road. It was magical.","Due to differences in the file formats, attempting other unsupported and undocumented paths may lead to broken projects or other issues.","However, as Apple warned, as Final Cut Pro (for Mac) and Final Cut Pro (for iPad) were updated and improved, Transfer Toolbox stopped working.","It became clear that the workaround that made Transfer Toolbox work, was no longer a possibility.","It was pretty amazing being able to setup a project on Mac, and just AirDrop it across to iPad to continue working, then send it back to Mac.","Onwards & Upwards!","Our initial plan was to provide this tool on the Mac App Store (like our other tools such as BRAW Toolbox, Marker Toolbox& Gyroflow Toolbox), however Apple rejected it because:","Quite simply, Final Cut Pro (for iPad) uses different core technologies under the hood than Final Cut Pro (for Mac).","So whilst we loved the ability to be able to seamlessly move from Mac to iPad in the early days of Final Cut Pro (for iPad), we now realise that only Apple can do this functionality properly.","Thank you to EVERYONE who downloaded and supported Transfer Toolbox!","The Transfer Toolbox icon was designed by the amazing Matthew Skiles. Hopefully we can eventually use it for something else!","Transfer Toolbox continued to work with the release of Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac) and Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad), and we got a lot of great feedback.","Transfer Toolbox has since been downloaded over 418 times on GitHub.","Undeterred, we decided to release it for free on this website, via GitHub.","We would encourage you to provide feedback to Apple if you found Transfer Toolbox useful. The more people that request this functionality, the more likely they will eventually implement.","When Final Cut Pro for iPad was first introduced, we were very excited about the possibilities of being able to transfer jobs seamlessly between Mac & iPad.","With the initial release of Final Cut Pro 1.0 (for iPad), we were able to make this happen on the day of release - which was VERY exciting.","You can learn more about our other applications over at FCP Cafe."]}]]
