If you do, the iPad will just say \"Import Failed\".","If you have custom fonts on the Mac Final Cut Pro library, you should manually install them on the iPad before importing the project.","Not all Motion Templates will work on the iPad. For example, some Titles using the Match Move Behaviour don't appear correctly on Final Cut Pro (for iPad) - the positions are all wrong.","FxPlug4 effects (such as BRAW Toolbox) will not work at all on the iPad. Whilst Final Cut Pro (for iPad) does seem to have FxPlug4 Frameworks, there's currently no mechanism for third party to add FxPlug4 to iPad.","Final Cut Pro (for iPad) will always ignore proxy files- it will always use the Original high-quality media files.","Soundtracks will come across from iPad to Mac. However, they're not \"normal\" audio clips, and won't appear if you export a FCPXML.","Some users have reported that when you AirDrop from Mac to iPad, it can take a few minutes for the project to appear in Final Cut Pro for iPad. We haven't been able to reproduce this on a 12.9inch iPad Pro, so it may be hardware dependant. Basically... be patient if using older devices.","If you find any other issues/limitations, please let us know."]},{"l":"Storing Media Externally","p":["After creating a new Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project using Transfer Toolbox, you may need to open the library back up on the Mac, to update all the bookmarks.","As far as we can tell, there's currently no way to stop Final Cut Pro from importing the footage to your iPad's internal drive.","As long as both the generated Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project and media are on the same external hard drive, in the same location as they were on the Mac, everything will work.","However, even though Final Cut Pro (for iPad) will \"link\" to the external drive initially, and when you first start editing, you'll be editing off the external drive - in the background, Final Cut Pro will start copying everything across to the internal drive.","Interestingly, it is actually possible to \"link\" to media on an external hard drive.","Just select the project on your external drive:","Once you open it, and allow Background Tasks to complete, you can then close it, as the document-scope security-scoped bookmarks should now be updated.","Screenshot of Final Cut Pro (for iPad)","Screenshot of Finder","Simply right-click on the new Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project in Finder and select Show Package Contents.","The reason for this is that internally Final Cut Pro (for Mac) created document-scope security-scoped bookmarks to each media file, which Final Cut Pro (for iPad) can also use to get access to the files, even in a sandboxed environment.","This works slightly differently to DaVinci Resolve (for iPad) and LumaFusion, which both support \"linking\" to external drives without having a local/internal copy.","We will investigate automating this process in a future update.","With that in mind, if you still want to \"link\" to your media initially, you'll need to create the Final Cut Pro library on macOS, and make sure you keep the media external to the library.","Within the package contents, two folders deep, you'll find the Final Cut Pro (for Mac) library that you can now open on your Mac.","You can then import Final Cut Pro (for iPad) libraries via the home screen:"]}],[{"l":"Support","p":["If you run into any bugs, crashes, or you have a feature request, you can post an issue here.","If you have any general questions or feedback, you can discuss here.","GitHub registration is free, and this GitHub repository is actively monitored by LateNite Films.","You can also email us: support@latenitefilms.com","We're based in Melbourne, Australia- you can check the timezone here."]}],[{"l":"Release Notes"},{"i":"101","l":"1.0.1","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","26th May 2023","\uD83D\uDCDD Changes:","Changed the App Store Subtitle."]},{"i":"100","l":"1.0.0","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","26th May 2023","This is the first release of Transfer Toolbox.
