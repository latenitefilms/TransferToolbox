This means that, the duplicate file doesn't take up any extra space because it's just pointing to the same underlying data as the original file.","When sending your project from Final Cut Pro on iPad back to your Mac, just export with the Include All Media option disabled, and then manually relink to your iCloud Drive files within Final Cut Pro on Mac."]},{"l":"Storing Media Externally","p":["After creating a new Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project using Transfer Toolbox, you may need to open the library back up on the Mac, to update all the bookmarks.","As far as we can tell, there's currently no way to stop Final Cut Pro from importing the footage to your iPad's internal drive.","As long as both the generated Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project and media are on the same external hard drive, in the same location as they were on the Mac, everything will work.","However, even though Final Cut Pro (for iPad) will \"link\" to the external drive initially, and when you first start editing, you'll be editing off the external drive - in the background, Final Cut Pro will start copying everything across to the internal drive.","Interestingly, it is actually possible to \"link\" to media on an external hard drive.","Just select the project on your external drive:","Once you open it, and allow Background Tasks to complete, you can then close it, as the document-scope security-scoped bookmarks should now be updated.","Screenshot of Final Cut Pro (for iPad)","Screenshot of Finder","Simply right-click on the new Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project in Finder and select Show Package Contents.","The reason for this is that internally Final Cut Pro (for Mac) created document-scope security-scoped bookmarks to each media file, which Final Cut Pro (for iPad) can also use to get access to the files, even in a sandboxed environment.","This works slightly differently to DaVinci Resolve (for iPad) and LumaFusion, which both support \"linking\" to external drives without having a local/internal copy.","Unfortunately, whilst this worked on Final Cut Pro v1.0.0, Apple has removed support for this workflow in Final Cut Pro v1.0.1. We are still testing and exploring other possibilities and workarounds for \"linking to\" external media.","We will investigate automating this process in a future update.","With that in mind, if you still want to \"link\" to your media initially, you'll need to create the Final Cut Pro library on macOS, and make sure you keep the media external to the library.","Within the package contents, two folders deep, you'll find the Final Cut Pro (for Mac) library that you can now open on your Mac.","You can then import Final Cut Pro (for iPad) libraries via the home screen:"]},{"l":"Supported Media","p":["Below is a list of Supported Media in Final Cut Pro for iPad:"]},{"l":"Video Formats","p":["Apple ProRes","Apple ProRes RAW and Apple ProRes RAW HQ","H.264","HEVC","MXF (Apple ProRes)"]},{"l":"Audio Formats","p":["AAC","AIFF","BWF","CAF","MP3","MP4","WAV"]},{"l":"Stills Formats","p":["Apple ProRAW","BMP","GIF","HEIF","JPEG","PNG","PSD","RAW","TGA","TIFF","You can also find this information on Apple's website."]},{"l":"Camera Formats","p":["Final Cut Pro for iPad supports a wide range of third-party digital video and still cameras.","You can see the full list on Apple's website."]}],[{"l":"Workflow","p":["Why exactly would you want to move from a Mac to an iPad for Final Cut Pro?","This page offers some workflow ideas and suggestions."]},{"l":"Dailies","p":["Final Cut Pro for iPad is perfect for reviewing and doing selects on dailies for all levels of projects, from short films to Hollywood Feature Films.","When working in the advertising world, and especially in the corporate advertising world, a lot of agency staff don't have Mac laptops, but own an iPad.","Whilst it's possible to use something like Frame.io Camera to Cloud to share proxies straight from camera to your iPad, because of the way it works, the audio channels might be incorrect, which makes relinking a challenge on the Mac end.","The best option is to get an assistant editor to sync (using something like Sync-N-Link), and organise everything on the Mac.","Once everything is ready to go on the Mac, you can use Transfer Toolbox to convert your Final Cut Pro for Mac library into a self-contained Final Cut Pro for iPad project.","You can then send the project to clients/agency/director/mother via email, AirDrop, PostLab, iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Digital Pigeon, Frame.io, etc.","They can do their selects on the iPad, and once done, then the project back (without media), where the assistant can then open up on Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 and consolidate with the master library.","Because of it's touch interface and Apple Pencil support, the iPad is the perfect rushes review platform - as it's fast and fun.","Directors can also experiment with edits on Final Cut Pro for iPad - and everything will transfer perfectly back to the Mac."]}],[{"l":"Support","p":["If you run into any bugs, crashes, or you have a feature request, you can post an issue here.","If you have any general questions or feedback, you can discuss here.","GitHub registration is free, and this GitHub repository is actively monitored by LateNite Films.","You can also email us: support@latenitefilms.com","We're based in Melbourne, Australia- you can check the timezone here."]}],[{"l":"Release Notes"},{"i":"102","l":"1.0.2","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","18th June 2023","\uD83D\uDCDD Changes:","Transfer Toolbox will no longer be distributed on the Apple App Store or TestFlight, and instead will be a free download."]},{"i":"101","l":"1.0.1","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","26th May 2023","\uD83D\uDCDD Changes:","Changed the App Store Subtitle."]},{"i":"100","l":"1.0.0","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","26th May 2023","Woohoo! \uD83C\uDF89","This is the first release of Transfer Toolbox on Apple's TestFlight."]}],[{"l":"Uninstall","p":["To uninstall Transfer Toolbox, simply drag the application to the trash/bin."]}],[{"l":"Credits","p":["Transfer Toolbox has been thrown together by Chris Hocking at LateNite Films.","The Transfer Toolbox icon was designed by Matthew Skiles.","The Goblins featured in the icon are from LateNite's Goblin Spoon series, created by Nicholas Issell.","Special thanks to David Peterson!","Chris also created CommandPost, BRAW Toolbox, Marker Toolbox and Gyroflow Toolbox."]},{"l":"Sparkle","p":["Transfer Toolbox uses Sparkle for software updates.","Copyright (c) 2006-2013 Andy Matuschak.
