Whilst Final Cut Pro (for iPad) does seem to have FxPlug4 Frameworks, there's currently no mechanism for third party to add FxPlug4 to iPad.","If you find any other issues or limitations, please let us know.","If you have custom fonts on the Mac Final Cut Pro library, you should manually install them on the iPad before importing the project.","If you use a different event name, you may not see anything in your browser on the iPad.","Multicam Clips with more than 4 angles will come across correctly, however you still only have access to the first 4 angles in Final Cut Pro for iPad.","Not all Motion Templates will work on the iPad. For example, some Titles using the Match Move Behaviour don't appear correctly on Final Cut Pro (for iPad) - the positions are all wrong.","Some users have reported that when you AirDrop from Mac to iPad, it can take a few minutes for the project to appear in Final Cut Pro for iPad. We haven't been able to reproduce this on a 12.9inch iPad Pro, so it may be hardware dependant. Basically... be patient if using \"older\" devices.","Some very important things to keep in mind:","Soundtracks will come across from iPad to Mac. However, they're not \"normal\" audio clips, and won't appear if you export a FCPXML. This bug has been reported to Apple.","The Flow transition does work correctly between Mac and iPad, however, interestingly, the rendering results can be visually different between platforms. Mac seems better quality than iPad.","Transfer Toolbox has been tested on Final Cut Pro v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 for iPad.","Transfer Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or later.","Transfer Toolbox will warn you if it detects more than one event, but it still allows you to proceed.","You should ensure your library only has a single event with the following name: Default MM-DD-YY(i.e Default 05-31-23).","Your Final Cut Pro (for Mac) timeline/project cannot have any Stabilisation or Rolling Shutter effects enabled. If you do, the iPad will just say Import Failed."]},{"l":"Danger using External Drives on iPad","p":["The fact that you can just plug in an external drive into an iPad Pro via USB-C is awesome and amazing!","However, for whatever strange reason, Apple decided not to include an Eject button in the Files app.","We've now seen cases where if you \"pull the plug\" on an macOS Extended or HFS+ formatted external drive, whilst the iPad is still working on it, it can corrupt the the HFS+ partition.","We haven't seen it happen first hand yet, however we suspect the same issue would happen on APFS formatted drives.","Once corrupted, the drive no longer appears on iPad.","What's worse is that once the external drive is corrupt, as soon as you plug it into an Apple Silicon or Intel Mac, it will just crash the system straight away. An instant and fatal kernel panic.","The only way we've been able to fix the corrupt drives is to use a Windows PC, and use HFS+ for Windows by Paragon Software to mount and repair the drive.","Once repaired on Windows, it works fine again on macOS and iPad.","Given this, it's our strong recommendation that if you're using an external drives on iPad, that before you \"pull the plug\" you \"force quit\" all applications or better yet, shutdown the iPad whenever ejecting drives.","You can force quit application on the iPad, by tapping the bottom of the screen and dragging up to the middle, then stopping. This opens the App Switcher. You can then swipe up on an app to force quit it.","If you're external drive has an LED status light, that's another good way to determine if the iPad is still doing \"stuff\" with it."]},{"l":"Storing Media on iCloud","p":["It is possible to store your media on iCloud Drive and effectively \"share it\" between your Mac and your iPad.","When you import media into Final Cut Pro for iPad it will always copy to the library.","However, because iPad's use Apple File System (APFS) for their internal storage, even thought it's copying the files from the iCloud drive cache to the Final Cut Pro library, it doesn't actually take up any more \"physical\" drive space.","When you duplicate a file in APFS, rather than immediately making a complete second copy of the file, the file system essentially just creates a new reference, or pointer, to the existing data. This means that, the duplicate file doesn't take up any extra space because it's just pointing to the same underlying data as the original file.","When sending your project from Final Cut Pro on iPad back to your Mac, just export with the Include All Media option disabled, and then manually relink to your iCloud Drive files within Final Cut Pro on Mac."]},{"l":"Storing Media Externally","p":["After creating a new Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project using Transfer Toolbox, you may need to open the library back up on the Mac, to update all the bookmarks.","As far as we can tell, there's currently no way to stop Final Cut Pro from importing the footage to your iPad's internal drive.","As long as both the generated Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project and media are on the same external hard drive, in the same location as they were on the Mac, everything will work.","However, even though Final Cut Pro (for iPad) will \"link\" to the external drive initially, and when you first start editing, you'll be editing off the external drive - in the background, Final Cut Pro will start copying everything across to the internal drive.","Interestingly, it is actually possible to \"link\" to media on an external hard drive.","Just select the project on your external drive:","Once you open it, and allow Background Tasks to complete, you can then close it, as the document-scope security-scoped bookmarks should now be updated.","Screenshot of Final Cut Pro (for iPad)","Screenshot of Finder","Simply right-click on the new Final Cut Pro (for iPad) project in Finder and select Show Package Contents.","The reason for this is that internally Final Cut Pro (for Mac) created document-scope security-scoped bookmarks to each media file, which Final Cut Pro (for iPad) can also use to get access to the files, even in a sandboxed environment.","This works slightly differently to DaVinci Resolve (for iPad) and LumaFusion, which both support \"linking\" to external drives without having a local/internal copy.","Unfortunately, whilst this worked on Final Cut Pro v1.0.0, Apple has removed support for this workflow in Final Cut Pro v1.0.1. We are still testing and exploring other possibilities and workarounds for \"linking to\" external media.","We will investigate automating this process in a future update.","With that in mind, if you still want to \"link\" to your media initially, you'll need to create the Final Cut Pro library on macOS, and make sure you keep the media external to the library.","Within the package contents, two folders deep, you'll find the Final Cut Pro (for Mac) library that you can now open on your Mac.","You can then import Final Cut Pro (for iPad) libraries via the home screen:"]},{"l":"Supported Media in Final Cut Pro for iPad"},{"l":"Video Formats","p":["Apple ProRes","Apple ProRes RAW and Apple ProRes RAW HQ","H.264","HEVC","MXF (Apple ProRes)"]},{"l":"Audio Formats","p":["AAC","AIFF","BWF","CAF","MP3","MP4","WAV"]},{"l":"Still-image Formats","p":["Apple ProRAW","BMP","GIF","HEIF","JPEG","PNG","PSD","RAW","TGA","TIFF","You can also find this information on Apple's website."]}],[{"l":"Workflow","p":["Why exactly would you want to move from a Mac to an iPad for Final Cut Pro?","This page offers some workflow ideas and suggestions."]},{"l":"Dailies","p":["Final Cut Pro for iPad is perfect for reviewing and doing selects on dailies for all levels of projects, from short films to Hollywood Feature Films.","When working in the advertising world, and especially in the corporate advertising world, a lot of agency staff don't have Mac laptops, but own an iPad.","Whilst it's possible to use something like Frame.io Camera to Cloud to share proxies straight from camera to your iPad, because of the way it works, the audio channels might be incorrect, which makes relinking a challenge on the Mac end.","The best option is to get an assistant editor to sync (using something like Sync-N-Link), and organise everything on the Mac.","Once everything is ready to go on the Mac, you can use Transfer Toolbox to convert your Final Cut Pro for Mac library into a self-contained Final Cut Pro for iPad project.","You can then send the project to clients/agency/director/mother via email, AirDrop, PostLab, iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Digital Pigeon, Frame.io, etc.","They can do their selects on the iPad, and once done, then the project back (without media), where the assistant can then open up on Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 and consolidate with the master library.","Because of it's touch interface and Apple Pencil support, the iPad is the perfect rushes review platform - as it's fast and fun.","Directors can also experiment with edits on Final Cut Pro for iPad - and everything will transfer perfectly back to the Mac."]}],[{"l":"Support","p":["If you run into any bugs, crashes, or you have a feature request, you can post an issue here.","If you have any general questions or feedback, you can discuss here.","GitHub registration is free, and this GitHub repository is actively monitored by LateNite Films.","You can also email us: support@latenitefilms.com","We're based in Melbourne, Australia- you can check the timezone here."]}],[{"l":"Release Notes"},{"i":"101","l":"1.0.1","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","26th May 2023","\uD83D\uDCDD Changes:","Changed the App Store Subtitle."]},{"i":"100","l":"1.0.0","p":["\uD83C\uDF89 Released:","26th May 2023","This is the first release of Transfer Toolbox.
