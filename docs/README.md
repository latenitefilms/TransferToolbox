**Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)** and **Final Cut Pro 10.6.8 (for Mac)** uses a newer Library format than **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**.<br />
This means that if you want to use Transfer Toolbox to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)** and **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**.

We are currently actively investigating **Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 (for Mac)** and **Final Cut Pro 1.2 (for iPad)** support.

Transfer Toolbox allows you to convert **Final Cut Pro (for Mac) Libraries** into **Final Cut Pro (for iPad) Projects**!
