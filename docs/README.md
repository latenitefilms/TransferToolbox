# Transfer Toolbox

!!!danger
Transfer Toolbox has **not yet** been released on the Mac App Store.

We submitted to App Review on 25th May, and it was rejected on 3rd June for apparently violating [App Store Guideline 2.5.1](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements){target="_blank"}.

We are currently appealing this decision, and have a phone call scheduled with the App Review team this week.

In the meantime, you can download Transfer Toolbox for **free** via [Apple's TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wccbIev6){target="_blank"}.

If we can't resolve Apple's issues, we'll explore other distribution options. Stay tuned!
!!!

Transfer Toolbox allows you to convert Final Cut Pro (for Mac) libraries into Final Cut Pro (for iPad) projects!
