# Transfer Toolbox

After very careful consideration, we've decided to **stop the development of Transfer Toolbox**.

When Final Cut Pro for iPad was first introduced, we were very excited about the possibilities of being able to transfer jobs seamlessly between Mac & iPad.

Because we use [Sync-N-Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sync-n-link-x/id517599985?mt=12) for synchronising all our timecode-synced cameras and external audio recorders, our ideal workflow was to be able to prepare everything on Mac, and just send across a Library from Mac to iPad, so that creatives/directors could start doing selects/favouriting directly on the iPad.

With the initial release of **Final Cut Pro 1.0 (for iPad)**, we were able to make this happen on the day of release - which was VERY exciting.

Directors loved being able to do fast selects/favourites using their Apple Pencil on the road. It was magical.

Our initial plan was to provide this tool on the Mac App Store (like our other tools such as [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.io), [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.io) & [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.io)), however Apple rejected it because:

> Due to differences in the file formats, attempting other unsupported and undocumented paths may lead to broken projects or other issues.

Undeterred, we decided to release it for free on this website, via GitHub.

Before releasing on GitHub, we had **107 beta testers** on Apple's TestFlight, which provided really useful support and feedback. There was a lot of interest on social media.

Transfer Toolbox has since been downloaded over **418 times** on GitHub.

Transfer Toolbox continued to work with the release of **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)** and **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**, and we got a lot of great feedback.

It was pretty amazing being able to setup a project on Mac, and just AirDrop it across to iPad to continue working, then send it back to Mac.

However, as Apple warned, as **Final Cut Pro (for Mac)** and **Final Cut Pro (for iPad)** were updated and improved, Transfer Toolbox stopped working.

It became clear that the workaround that made Transfer Toolbox work, was no longer a possibility.

As we dug deeper into how Final Cut Pro (for Mac) Libraries differ from Final Cut Pro (for iPad) Projects with each update - it became obvious that, the technologies between the two platforms is quite different, and ever evolving.

Apple seems to have been able to almost "start from scratch" with the iPad, and build newer modern frameworks, to really push the boundaries of what you can do on Apple Silicon.

Quite simply, Final Cut Pro (for iPad) uses different core technologies under the hood than Final Cut Pro (for Mac).

So whilst we loved the ability to be able to seamlessly move from Mac to iPad in the early days of Final Cut Pro (for iPad), we now realise that only Apple can do this functionality properly.

We would encourage you to [provide feedback to Apple](https://www.apple.com/feedback/finalcutpro/) if you found Transfer Toolbox useful. The more people that request this functionality, the more likely they will eventually implement.

The Transfer Toolbox icon was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](https://matthewskiles.com). Hopefully we can eventually use it for something else!

Thank you to EVERYONE who downloaded and supported Transfer Toolbox!
