# Buy on Mac App Store

!!!
**NOTE:** Transfer Toolbox has **not yet** been released on the Mac App Store.

We submitted to App Review on 25th May, and it was rejected on 3rd June for apparently violating [App Store Guideline 2.5.1](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements){target="_blank"}.

We are currently appealing this decision, and have a phone call scheduled with the App Review team this week.

In the meantime, you can download Transfer Toolbox for **free** via [Apple's TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wccbIev6).

If we can't resolve Apple's issues, we'll explore other distribution options. Stay tuned!

**Transfer Toolbox** is a one-time payment of **4.99**.

This is generally **4.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD4.99**, **USD4.99**, **CAD4.99**).

However, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a **USD$4.99 equivalent**.
