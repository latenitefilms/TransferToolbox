# Buy on Mac App Store

!!!
**NOTE:** Transfer Toolbox has **not yet** been released on the Mac App Store.

We submitted to App Review on 25th May at 7pm, and are still awaiting approval or rejection.

In the meantime, you can [access via Apple's TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wccbIev6).

If we can't release on the Mac App Store for whatever reason, we'll explore other distribution options. Stay tuned!

**Transfer Toolbox** is a one-time payment of **$4.99**.

This is generally $4.99 in your local currency (i.e. AUD4.99, USD4.99, CAD4.99).

However, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of $4.99 (i.e. Â¥700), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.
