# Buy on Mac App Store

!!!
**NOTE:** Transfer Toolbox has **not yet** been released on the Mac App Store.

We submitted to App Review on 25th May at 7pm, and are still awaiting approval or rejection.

If we can't release on the Mac App Store for whatever reason, we'll explore other distribution options. Stay tuned!

However, if you want to test via TestFlight, [please get in touch](https://transfertoolbox.io/support/).
!!!

**Transfer Toolbox** is a one-time payment of **$4.99**.

This is generally $4.99 in your local currency (i.e. AUD4.99, USD4.99, CAD4.99).

However, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of $4.99 (i.e. Â¥700), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.
