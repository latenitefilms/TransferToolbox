You will be presented with a Open Panel to grant sandbox access to that library:

After clicking **Grant Access**, you'll be presented with a success message:

You'll now find a `.fcpproj` file in the same folder as your `.fcpbundle`:

## Tips

Some important things to keep in mind:

- Transfer Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or later.
- You should ensure your library only has a single event.
- All project timecode should start at **00:00:00:00**.
- All Motion Content and Media should be contained within the Library.
- If you have custom fonts on the Mac Final Cut Pro library, you should manually install them on the iPad before importing the project.
- Not all Motion Templates will work on the iPad.
- FxPlug4 effects will not work at all on the iPad.
